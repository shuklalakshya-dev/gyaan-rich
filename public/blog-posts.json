Click here to skip to Step #1 of the free guide and start building your blog now!\n\nAfter completing this guide you will have a beautiful blog that is ready to share with the world.\n\nThis guide is made especially for beginners. I will walk you through each and every step, using plenty of pictures and videos to make it all perfectly clear.\n\nIf you get stuck or have questions at any point, simply send me a message and I will do my best to help you out.\n\nHow to start a blog for beginners \n\nMy name is Scott Chow, and I am going to show you how to start blogging today. I have been building blogs and websites since 2002. In that time I have launched several of my own blogs, and helped hundreds of others do the same.\n\nI know that starting a blog can seem overwhelming and intimidating. This free guide is all about blogging for beginners, and will teach you how to become a blogger with just the most basic computer skills. So whether you’re 8 or 88, you can create your own blog in 20 minutes.\n\nI am not ashamed to admit that when I was first learning how to build a blog I made a ton of mistakes. You can benefit from more than a decade of my experience so that you don’t repeat these same mistakes when you make your own blog. I created this free guide so that a complete beginner can learn how to blog quickly and easily.\n\nSo, just how do you start a blog?\n\nLearn how to create a blog in about 20 minutes following these steps:\n\nHow to Start a Blog in 6 Steps\nPick a blog name. Choose a descriptive name for your blog.\nGet your blog online. Register your blog and get hosting.\nCustomize your blog. Choose a free blog design template and tweak it.\nWrite & publish your first post. Share your thoughts with the world. The fun part!\nPromote your blog. Get more people to read your blog with the proper marketing.\nMake money blogging. Choose from several options to monetize your blog.\nShould you start a blog?\nOne of the misconceptions about starting a blog is that you need to be a great writer to be successful. Nothing could be further from the truth. People read blog sites to get a personal perspective on things, so most bloggers write in a very informal and conversational style.\n\nAnd because of the format, many successful bloggers will write about a variety of topics on the same blog.\n\nIn addition, you don’t need to be an expert on any of the topics you write about to have a successful blog. For example, visitors to a cooking blog don’t want to read a textbook from a food scientist, they want to hear the experiences of someone who has actually cooked some real meals, mistakes and all.\n\nTo be successful as a blogger there is really just one requirement: a passion for your topic.\n\nAt its heart, blogging is about sharing your knowledge with the world. Writing about things that you are passionate about makes the process of starting a successful blog so much easier. As long as you are writing about things that you are genuinely interested in, your passion will shine through and keep your visitors interested.\n\nSo why would you go to the trouble of blogging? There are a few reasons:\n\nShare your story. A blog allows you to have a voice and be heard. You can share your story with the entire world if you so choose. One of the most common ways blogs are used are as a diary where the blogger writes about their daily experiences so that friends, family, and others can all be a part of their lives.\nMake money from home. Blogging can be quite lucrative if done correctly. The top bloggers in the world obviously earn quite a bit, but even a part-time blogger can expect to make a nice profit if things are done correctly. The best part about it is that blogging is a form of passive income, since you can spend just a few hours a week writing a piece of content and then continue to profit from it long after the the writing is finished. I go into much more detail on how to blog for money later in this guide.\nRecognition for yourself or your business. No, you probably won’t have paparazzi following you around because of your latest post. But a successful blog makes your idea into a reality, and can gain you a ton of recognition in your respective field. Many bloggers are known as experts just because of their blogs, and some have even gotten book and movie deals based on their blogs.\nFind a community. Blogging at its heart is interactive. You write a post and people comment on it. This is a good way to connect with people who are interested in the same things as you are. Blogging allows you to teach these people based on your experience, and it gives you the opportunity to learn from your readers as well.</p>",
